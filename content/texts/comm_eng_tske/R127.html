This enumeration is widely different from that of the preceding. In that, we have the order and course of the priests and Levites, in their ecclesiastical ministrations: in this, we have the account of the order of the civil service, what related simply to the political state of the king and kingdom. Twenty-four persons, chosen out of David's worthies, each of whom had a second, were placed over 24,000 men, who all served a month at a time, in turn; and this was the whole of their service during the year, after which they attended to their own affairs. Thus the king had always on foot a regular force of 24,000, who served without expense to him or the state, and were not oppressed by the service, which took up only a twelfth part of their time; and by this plan he could, at any time, bring into the field 12 times 24,000 or 288,000 fighting men, independently of the 12,000 officers, which made in the whole an effective force of 300,000 soldiers; and all these men were prepared, disciplined, and ready at a call, without the smallest expense to the state or the king. These were, properly speaking, the militia of the Israelitish kingdom.<span class="note-word">captains</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="R113_1">1 Chronicles 13:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX18_25">Exodus 18:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT1_15">Deuteronomy 1:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S18_12">1 Samuel 8:12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MC5_2">Micah 5:2</span> <span class="note-word">served</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="R128_1">1 Chronicles 28:1</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R217_12">2 Chronicles 17:12-19</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_11">26:11-13</span> <span class="note-word">any matter</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="K15_14">1 Kings 5:14</span> <span class="note-word">month</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_7">4:7</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_27">4:27</span><span class="note-word">Reciprocal</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU1_4">Numbers 1:4</span> - <i>General</i>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R17_2">1 Chronicles 7:2</span> - whose number; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_6">29:6</span> - the chief; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R21_2">2 Chronicles 1:2</span> - to the captains; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R225_5">25:5</span> - captains over thousands</span>

"The sycamore," says Mr. Norden, "is of the height of a beech, and bears its fruit in a manner quite different from other trees: it has them on the trunk itself, which shoots out little sprigs, in form of grape stalks, at the end of which grow the fruit close to one another, almost like a cluster of grapes. The tree is always green, and bears fruit several times in the year, without observing any certain seasons; for I have seen some sycamores that have given fruit two months after others. The fruit has the figure and smell of real figs, but is inferior to them in the taste, having a disgusting sweetness. Its colour is a yellow, inclining to an ochre, shadowed by a flesh colour. In the inside it resembles the common figs, excepting that it has a blackish colouring with yellow spots. This sort of tree is pretty common in Egypt; the people, for the greater part, live on its fruit, and think themselves well regaled when they have a piece of bread, a couple of sycamore figs, and a pitcher of water." <span class="bibleref" data-id="K120_27">20:27</span><span class="note-word">Reciprocal</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="R29_27">2 Chronicles 9:27</span> - the sycamore; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS78_47">Psalm 78:47</span> - sycamore; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK19_4">Luke 19:4</span> - a sycamore</span>
