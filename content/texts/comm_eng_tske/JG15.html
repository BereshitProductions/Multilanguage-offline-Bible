But:<br><br>1. The word lachad, rendered caught, never signifies simply to get or take but always to catch, seize, or take by assault or stratagem.<br><br>2. Though the proposed alteration is sanctioned by seven manuscripts, yet all the versions are on the other side.<br><br>3. Admitting this alteration, it will be difficult to prove that the word shoal means either a sheaf or a handful of corn in the ear, and straw. It occurs but thrice in Scriptures - <span class="bibleref" data-id="K120_10">1 Kings 20:10</span>. <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS40_12">Isaiah 40:12</span>. <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK13_9">Ezekiel 13:9</span></i>: where it evidently means as much as can be contained in the hollow of the hand; but when handfuls of grain in the shock, or sheaves are intended, very different words are used. See note on <span class="bibleref" data-id="RT2_15">Ruth 2:15</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="RT2_16">2:16</span>, etc.<br><br>4. It is not hinted that Samson collected them alone, or in one day; he might have employed many hands and several days in the work.<br><br>5. The word shual properly denotes the jackal, which travellers describe as an animal in size between the wolf and fox, gregarious, as many as 200 having been seen together, and the most numerous of any in eastern countries; so that Samson might have caught many of them together in nets. <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS63_10">Psalm 63:10</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="SS2_15">Song of Songs 2:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LM5_18">Lamentations 5:18</span> <span class="note-word">firebrands</span>or, torches<span class="note-word">Reciprocal</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX22_6">Exodus 22:6</span> - so that the stacks of corn; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S214_30">2 Samuel 14:30</span> - go and set</span>
