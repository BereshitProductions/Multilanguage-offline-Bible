That these could not have been looking glasses, as in our translation, is sufficiently evident, not only from the glass not being then in use, but also from the impossibility of making the brazen laver of such materials. The first mirrors known among men, were the clear fountain and unruffled lake. The first artificial ones were made of polished brass, afterwards of steel, and when luxury increased, of silver; but at a very early period, they were made of a mixed metal, particularly of tin and copper, the best of which, as Pliny informs us, were formerly manufactured at Brundusium. When the Egyptians went to their temples, according to St. Cyril, they always carried their mirrors with them. The Israelitish women probably did the same; and Dr. Shaw says, that looking-glasses are still part of the dress of Moorish women, who carry them constantly hung at their breasts.<span class="note-word">assembling</span>Heb. assembling by troops, It is supposed that these women kept watch during the night.

Christ alone builds the Temple of the Lord, and bears the glory; but ministers and private Christians, under his direction and by his grace, may be fellow-workers together with him. They who, in mean employments, are diligent and humbly contented, are equally acceptable with those who are engaged in more splendid services. The women who spun the goats' hair were wise-hearted, as well as the persons who presided over the work of the tabernacle, or as Aaron, who burnt incense there, because they did it heartily unto the Lord. Our wisdom and duty consist in giving God the glory and use of our talents, be they more or less; neither abusing nor burying them, but occupying with them until our Lord shall come; being satisfied that it is better to be a door-keeper in his service, than the most mighty and renowned of the ungodly. - Scott.<span class="note-word">all that the Lord</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="PS119_6">Psalm 119:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR1_7">Jeremiah 1:7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="MT28_20">Matthew 28:20</span><span class="note-word">Reciprocal</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="R12_20">1 Chronicles 2:20</span> - Bezaleel</span>

The value of the silver contributed by 603,550; Israelites, at half a shekel, or 1s. 6d. per man, will amount to 45,266. 5s. The value of the 70 talents, 2,400 shekels of brass, will be 513. 17s. The gold weighed 4,245 pounds; the silver, 14,603 pounds; and the brass, 10,277 pounds, troy weight. The total value of all the gold, silver, and brass, will consequently amount to 244,127. 14s. 6d.; and the total weight of these three metals will amount to 29,124 pounds troy, which reduced to avoirdupois weight, is equal to fourteen tons, 226 pounds! - It may, perhaps, seem difficult to imagine how the Israelites should be possessed of so much wealth in the desert; but it should be remembered, that their ancestors were opulent men before they came into Egypt; that they were further enriched by the spoils of the Egyptians and Amalekites; and that it is probable, they traded with the neighbouring nations who bordered on the wilderness. There appear to be three reasons why so much riches should have been employed in the construction of the tabernacle, etc. <br><br>1. To impress the people's minds with the glory and dignity of the Divine Majesty, and the importance of his service.<br><br>2. To take out of their hands the occasion of covetousness.<br><br>3. To prevent pride and vain glory, by leading them to give up to the divine service even the ornaments of their persons. <span class="bibleref" data-id="R122_14">1 Chronicles 22:14-16</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="R129_2">29:2-7</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HG2_8">Haggai 2:8</span> <span class="note-word">offering</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX25_2">Exodus 25:2</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX29_24">29:24</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX35_22">35:22</span> <span class="note-word">the shekel</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_13">30:13</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_14">30:14</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX30_24">30:24</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV5_15">Leviticus 5:15</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV27_3">27:3</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV27_25">27:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_47">Numbers 3:47</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU18_16">18:16</span><span class="note-word">Reciprocal</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU3_25">3:25</span> - the charge; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K25_22">2 Kings 5:22</span> - a talent</span>
