This, which was their new year's day, was a time of great festivity, and ushered in by the blowing of trumpets; whence it was also called the feast of blowing the trumpets. In imitation of this Jewish festival, different nations began the new year with sacrifices and festivity. The ancient Egyptians did so; and the Persians also celebrated their nawee rooz, or new year's day, which they held on the vernal equinox, and which "lasted ten days, during which all ranks seemed to participate in one general joy. The rich sent presents to the poor; all were dressed in their holiday clothes; all kept open house; and religious processions, music, dancing, a species of theatrical exhibition, rustic sports, and other pastimes, presented a continued round of varied amusement. Even the dead, and the ideal beings were not forgotten; rich viands being placed on the tops of houses and high towers, on the flavour of which the Peris, and spirits of their departed heroes and friends, were supposed to feast." After the Mohammedan conquest of Persia, the celebration of this period sensibly declined, and at last totally ceased, till the time of Jelaladdin - about ad 1082<br>who, coming to the crown at the vernal equinox, re-established the ancient festival, which has ever since been celebrated with pomp and acclamations. <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_24">Leviticus 23:24</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_25">23:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER3_6">Ezra 3:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH7_73">Nehemiah 7:73</span> <span class="note-word">the first day of the month</span>The monthly sacrifices were regulated by the new moons; and it is probable that the solemn sacrifices were appointed by God, to prevent the idolatry which was usual among the heathen at this period; who expressed the most extravagant rejoicings on the first appearance of the new moon. Moses, however, used the return of the moon only as one of the most natural and convenient measures of time; and appointed sacrifices to Jehovah, to prevent the Israelites from falling into the idolatries of their heathen neighbours.

<span class="comm-v-num">Verse 12</span><span class="v NU29_12" data-id="NU29_12"><span class="note-word">the fifteenth day</span>This was the feast of Tabernacles, kept in commemoration of their dwelling in tents in the wilderness for forty years. The first and last days were to be kept as sabbaths, on which there were solemn assemblies; and for seven days sacrifices were offered. On the other festivals, two bullocks sufficed - <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_11">Numbers 28:11</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_19">28:19</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_27">28:27</span><br>and on the festival at the beginning of this month, only one was appointed; but, on the first day of this festival, thirteen young bullocks were appointed; and so on each successive day, with the decrease of only one bullock, till on the seventh day, there were only seven, making in all seventy bullocks. The lambs, and the rams also, were in a double proportion to the number sacrificed at any other festival. This was an expensive service; but more easy at this time of the year than any other, as Bishop Patrick observes, because now their barns were full, and their wine-presses overflowed; and their hearts might well be supposed to be more enlarged than at other times, in thankfulness to God for the multitude of his mercies. The Jewish doctors give this reason for the daily diminution of the number of the bullocks: the whole number, say they, was according to the languages of the seventy nations of the world; and the diminution of one every day signified, that there should be a gradual diminution of those nations till all things were brought under the government of the Messiah; in whose days "no sacrifices shall remain, but those of thanksgiving, prayer, and praise." <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX23_16">Exodus 23:16</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX34_22">34:22</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_33">Leviticus 23:33-43</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_13">Deuteronomy 16:13</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_14">16:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH8_14">Nehemiah 8:14</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH8_18">8:18</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK45_25">Ezekiel 45:25</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC14_16">Zechariah 14:16-19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN1_14">John 1:14</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HK3_1">Habakkuk 3:1-11:13</span><span class="note-word">Reciprocal</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="EX10_9">Exodus 10:9</span> - a feast; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EX12_16">12:16</span> - first day; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_34">Leviticus 23:34</span> - The fifteenth; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_36">23:36</span> - Seven; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_41">23:41</span> - <i>General</i>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_25">Numbers 28:25</span> - ye shall do; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT16_15">Deuteronomy 16:15</span> - Seven days; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG21_19">Judges 21:19</span> - a feast; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K18_2">1 Kings 8:2</span> - at the feast; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K112_32">12:32</span> - like unto; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R27_8">2 Chronicles 7:8</span> - kept; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER3_4">Ezra 3:4</span> - the daily; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN7_2">John 7:2</span> - <i>General</i>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN7_14">7:14</span> - the midst</span>

On every one of them two rams and fourteen lambs were offered; but on this day there were but half as many; and whereas seven bullocks were the fewest that were offered on any of those days, on this there was only one. At this feast, there was an extraordinary ceremony of which the rabbins inform us, namely, the drawing water out of the pool of Siloam, and pouring it, mixed with wine, on the sacrifice as it lay on the altar. This they are said to have done with such expressions of joy, that it became a common proverb, "He that never saw the rejoicing of drawing of water, never saw rejoicing in all his life." The Jews pretend to ground this custom on the following passage of Isaiah - <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS12_3">Isaiah 12:3</span><br>"With joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation;" and to this ceremony Jesus is supposed to refer, when "in the last day, the great day of the feast, he stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink: he that believeth on me, as the Scripture saith, out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" - <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN7_37">John 7:37</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN7_38">7:38</span><br>thereby calling off the people from their carnal mirth and festive and pompous ceremonies, to seek spiritual refreshment for their minds. <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_36">Leviticus 23:36</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JN7_37">John 7:37-39</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RV7_9">Revelation 7:9-17</span><span class="note-word">Reciprocal</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_25">Numbers 28:25</span> - ye shall do; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S17_6">1 Samuel 7:6</span> - drew water; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH8_18">Nehemiah 8:18</span> - according</span>

But how little is all this compared with the lambs slain every year at the passover. Cestius, the Roman general, asked the priests how many persons had come to Jerusalem at their annual festivals: the priests, numbering the people by the lambs that had been slain, said, "twenty-five myriads, 5,000, and 600." <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_2">Leviticus 23:2</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R123_31">1 Chronicles 23:31</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R231_3">2 Chronicles 31:3</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ER3_5">Ezra 3:5</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH10_33">Nehemiah 10:33</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="IS1_14">Isaiah 1:14</span> <span class="note-word">beside your vows</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="NU6_21">Numbers 6:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV7_11">Leviticus 7:11</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV7_16">7:16-38</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV22_21">22:21-23</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_28">23:28</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="DT12_6">Deuteronomy 12:6</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="C110_31">1 Corinthians 10:31</span><span class="note-word">Reciprocal</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="LV23_38">Leviticus 23:38</span> - and beside; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU28_10">Numbers 28:10</span> - the continual; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R231_14">2 Chronicles 31:14</span> - the freewill; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS119_108">Psalm 119:108</span> - Accept; <span class="bibleref" data-id="EK46_12">Ezekiel 46:12</span> - a voluntary</span>
