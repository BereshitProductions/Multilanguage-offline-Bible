It is said here that this was done at night; probably what was threshed out in the day was winnowed in the evening, when the sea breeze set in, which was common in Palestine.<span class="note-word">Reciprocal</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="LV25_25">Leviticus 25:25</span> - <i>General</i>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="RT2_1">Ruth 2:1</span> - kinsman</span>

These threshing-floors were covered at top to keep off the rain, but lay open on all sides, that the wind might come in freely, for winnowing the corn; which being done, it is probable they were shut up at night, with doors fitted to them, that if any one lay there he might be kept warm, and the corn be secured from robbers.<br><br></span>
