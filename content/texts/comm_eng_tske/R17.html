In the beginning of the following chapter, also, five are only mentioned, Bela, Ashbel, Aharah, Nohah, and Rapha; and Addar, Gera, Abihud, Abishua, Naaman, Ahoha, another Gera, Shephuphan, and Huram, are all represented as grandsons, not sons of Benjamin. Hence we see that in many cases, grandsons are called sons, and both are often confounded in the genealogical tables. It seems, also, that the persons mentioned in the following verses were neither sons nor grandsons of Bela and Becher, but distinguished persons among their descendants. <span class="bibleref" data-id="R18_1">1 Chronicles 8:1-12</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN46_21">Genesis 46:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NU26_38">Numbers 26:38-41</span> <span class="note-word">Jediael</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="R17_10">1 Chronicles 7:10</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="R17_11">7:11</span><br><br></span>

But Zebulun, as well as Dan, is here omitted, perhaps because none of either of these tribes returned at first from Babylon.
