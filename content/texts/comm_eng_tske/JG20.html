The place of their meeting was Mizpeh; they gathered together unto the Lord there; for Mizpeh was so very near to Shiloh, that their encampment might very well be supposed to reach from Mizpeh to Shiloh. Shiloh was a small town, and therefore, when there was a general meeting of the people to present themselves before God, they chose Mizpeh for their head quarters, which was the next adjoining city of note; perhaps, because they were not willing to give that trouble to Shiloh, which so great an assembly would occasion; it being the residence of the priests that attended the tabernacle.<span class="note-word">Reciprocal</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="GN14_14">Genesis 14:14</span> - Dan; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN21_31">21:31</span> - Beersheba; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN22_19">22:19</span> - to Beersheba; <span class="bibleref" data-id="GN26_23">26:23</span> - Beersheba; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JS11_3">Joshua 11:3</span> - land; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG21_1">Judges 21:1</span> - had sworn; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S217_11">2 Samuel 17:11</span> - all Israel; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K14_25">1 Kings 4:25</span> - from Dan; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K112_29">12:29</span> - Dan; <span class="bibleref" data-id="K223_8">2 Kings 23:8</span> - Beersheba; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R216_4">2 Chronicles 16:4</span> - Dan; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R219_4">19:4</span> - Beersheba; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH3_15">Nehemiah 3:15</span> - Mizpah; <span class="bibleref" data-id="NH11_27">11:27</span> - <i>General</i>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR4_15">Jeremiah 4:15</span> - a voice; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR8_16">8:16</span> - was heard; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JR40_6">40:6</span> - Mizpah; <span class="bibleref" data-id="HS9_9">Hosea 9:9</span> - Gibeah</span>

Lev. Clerc observes, that the 700 men left-handed seem therefore to have been made slingers, because they could not use the right hand, which is employed in managing heavier arms; and they could discharge the stones from the sling in a direction against which their opponents were not upon their guard, and thus do the greater execution. <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG3_15">Judges 3:15</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_2">1 Chronicles 12:2</span> <span class="note-word">sling stones</span>The sling was a very ancient warlike instrument; and, in the hands of those who were skilled in the use of it, produced astonishing effects. The inhabitants of the islands of Baleares, now Majorca and Minorca, were the most celebrated slingers of antiquity. They did not permit their children to break their fast, till they had struck down the bread they had to eat from the top of a pole, or some distant eminence. Vegetius tells us, that slingers could in general hit the mark at 600 feet distance. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_40">1 Samuel 17:40</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_49">17:49</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="S117_50">17:50</span>, <span class="bibleref" data-id="S125_29">25:29</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R226_14">2 Chronicles 26:14</span><br><br></span>

It is probable however, that it was near, and took its name from, the village of Remmon, mentioned by Eusebius, fifteen miles north from Jerusalem. It appears that rocks are still resorted to in the East, as places of security; and some of them are even capable of sustaining a siege. Deut. Lam. Roque says, that "The Grand Seignior, wishing to seize the person of the emir - Fakr-eddin, prince of the Druses<br>gave orders to the pacha to take him prisoner: he accordingly came in search of him, with a new army, in the district of Chouf, which is part of mount Lebanon, wherein is the village of Gesin, and close to it, the rock which served for a retreat to the emir. It is named in Arabic, Magara Gesin, i.e., the cavern of Gessin, by which name it is famous. The pacha pressed the emir so closely, that this unfortunate prince was obliged to shut himself up in the cleft of a great rock, with a small number of his officers. The pacha besieged him there several months; and was going to blow up the rock by a mine, when the emir capitulated.<span class="note-word">Reciprocal</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="JG20_15">Judges 20:15</span> - twenty; <span class="bibleref" data-id="JG21_14">21:14</span> - sufficed them not; <span class="bibleref" data-id="ZC14_10">Zechariah 14:10</span> - Rimmon</span>
