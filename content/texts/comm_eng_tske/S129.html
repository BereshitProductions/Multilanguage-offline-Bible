Had he fought for the Philistines, he would have fought against God and his country; and had he in the battle gone over to the Israelites, he would have deceived and become a traitor to the hospitable Achish. God therefore delivered him from such disgrace; and by the same kind Providence he was sent back to rescue his wives, and the wives and children of his people, from captivity. <span class="bibleref" data-id="S114_21">1 Samuel 14:21</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R112_19">1 Chronicles 12:19</span>; <span class="bibleref" data-id="LK16_8">Luke 16:8</span><span class="note-word">Reciprocal</span><span class="bibleref" data-id="S129_9">1 Samuel 29:9</span> - the princes; <span class="bibleref" data-id="S23_25">2 Samuel 3:25</span> - and to know; <span class="bibleref" data-id="R119_3">1 Chronicles 19:3</span> - but the princes; <span class="bibleref" data-id="PS56_1">Psalm 56:1</span> - when</span>
